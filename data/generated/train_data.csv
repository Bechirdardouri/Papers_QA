179e4a4f-02c7-44aa-bc70-a246e3f42b5d,What are glucocorticoids and how do they work in assisted reproductive technology cycles?,"Glucocorticoids are a class of medicines that reduce inflammation and suppress the body's immune system. In assisted reproductive technology cycles, they suppress the inflammation of the endometrium, which suggests they might improve the chance of embryo implantation and pregnancy.",Background,"Glucocorticoids are a class of medicines that are similar to the steroid hormones that are naturally made in the body. These medicines reduce inflammation and suppress the body's immune system. Glucocorticoids suppress the inflammation of the endometrium (the tissue in the womb where the embryo implants). Therefore, glucocorticoids have been suggested to improve the chance of embryo implantation and pregnancy in women undergoing IVF or ICSI cycles.",Boomsma_et_al-2022-Cochrane_Database_of_Systematic_Reviews
b8cb21a3-580c-4b70-993b-364882e97465,What is the main conclusion of the review on glucocorticoids and assisted reproductive technology cycles?,The review found insufficient evidence to support the routine use of peri-implantation glucocorticoids in subfertile women undergoing IVF or ICSI cycles.,Authors' conclusions,"Overall, there was insufficient evidence that administration of peri-implantation glucocorticoids in IVF/ICSI cycles influenced clinical outcomes. These findings were limited to the routine use of glucocorticoids in subfertile women undergoing IVF or ICSI, and cannot be extrapolated to women with autoantibodies, unexplained infertility or recurrent implantation failure.",Boomsma_et_al-2022-Cochrane_Database_of_Systematic_Reviews

There was no significant difference in multiple pregnancy rates, ongoing pregnancy rates, and miscarriage rates.",Summary of main results,"Adverse effects were also considered as a secondary outcome. We are uncertain about possible negative effects of glucocorticoids such as adverse effects or OHSS, but these were poorly reported. Only three trials reported the incidence of adverse effects from glucocorticoids and there were no cases documented. No studies reported the incidence of infections or fetal abnormalities.",Boomsma_et_al-2022-Cochrane_Database_of_Systematic_Reviews

Additionally, the review could not extrapolate the findings to women with autoantibodies, unexplained infertility, or recurrent implantation failure.",Potential biases in the review process,"The search was comprehensive and included clinical trial registries for ongoing trials. However, there is a possibility that some studies may have been missed. Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews: In women with autoimmune conditions undergoing ART, use of corticosteroids alone or in combination with low-dose aspirin has been reported to improve treatment outcomes. One recent systematic review including three studies reported improvement in clinical pregnancy and live birth rates following glucocorticoids in women with antithyroid antibodies undergoing ART.",Boomsma_et_al-2022-Cochrane_Database_of_Systematic_Reviews
